# Replication code and data for: Aging in a warming world: global  projections of cumulative and acute heat exposure of older adults
By Giacomo Falchetta, Enrica De Cian, Ian Sue Wing and Deborah Carr

To replicate the analysis:
- Download input data from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7859233
- Download all the 1km age and gender-stratified global population counts rasters from the following WorldPop page https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=24798
- Run "project_pop.R" script to make gridded age-stratified population scenarios data
- Run "projections_exposure_m.R" to quantify heat exposure metrics and generate figures and tables 

Manuscript under peer review. Upon publication, a link to the analysis will be made available at this repository.
